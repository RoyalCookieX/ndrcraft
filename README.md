# ndrcraft
This is my attempt at creating a voxel game using Rust.

## Features:
- Textured voxels
- First-person camera movement
- Face culling

## Camera Controls:
- A/D: Move Left & Right
- E/Q: Move Up and Down
- W/S: Move Forwards and Backwards
- Mouse: Look
- Escape: Close Application

## How to Build & Run (VSCode):
- Set up Rust with VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust
- In the project directory, run ``cargo run --release``, which will eventually generate ``target/release/ndrcraft.exe``, followed by executing it as well.
